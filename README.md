## Overview

This project is an **AI-based 8-puzzle solver** built with Python. It uses the **A\*** search algorithm with the **Manhattan Distance heuristic** to find the optimal path from a given puzzle state to the goal state. The project features a clean and interactive **Streamlit web app** for user interaction.
