# 🧩 8-Puzzle Solver (AI with A* Algorithm)

This project is an **AI-based 8-puzzle solver** built with Python. It uses the **A* search algorithm** with **Manhattan Distance heuristic** to find the optimal path from a given puzzle state to the goal state. The project also features a simple **Streamlit web app** for user interaction.
